{"name":"Mt4j-extensions","tagline":"Extensions to the MT4J Framework providing generic, stylable components for user interface.\t","body":"mt4j-extensions is a Java-based framework which enables users to create multi-touch capable user interfaces. By providing basic shapes and content types, it enables users to create sophisticated touch-based UIs that are completely configurable - by the developer. Mt4J provides a rich set of standard multi-touch gestures that can easily be used with all the components provided with the framework\r\n\r\nYet the components that are provided, while being technically sophisticated and feature-rich, can not be seen as usable by visual artists and user interface prototypers. It requires a vast amount of code to change the style and appearance of elements. My goal is to create higher level visible components, that can be intuitively used as building blocks in multi-touch applications.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nOriginally hosted [here](http://nuicode.com/projects/mt4j-extensions)\r\n<br/>\r\n***\r\nGSoC 2010 project\r\n<br/>\r\n[![GSoC 2010](http://db.tt/3SNsY3Nv)](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2010)\r\n<br/>\r\n**Student:** Seth Sandler\r\n<br/>\r\n**Mentor:** Christian Moore","google":"UA-38848919-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
